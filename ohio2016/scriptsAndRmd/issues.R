# Brookeville chem data:
# Sample from SU-35 is included in 2017_ESF_EFWS_NutrientData.... and is recorded
# with site ID SU-35_2.  One of the SU-35 dups was lost.  Also, the TP vial from
# the remaining SU-35 site broke in the freezer or during the autoclave.  No TP 
# measured from this site, so I estimated from an overall TP ~ TRP model.  No TOC
# data from this sample.  I think Karen spilled sample.  Please confirm (4/7/17).

# Revisit how ag land use is aggregrated.


# statModel.R
# How should the summary tool be used for model selection?  Remove all non-significant
# variables from full model?  Remove highest order interactions first?

# Need assistance in evaluating residual pattern in lme model.  Good enough?  What else can we try?

# How to asses overall p-value for lme model?
