# THIS CODE WILL BE USED TO READ THE POPULATED SHAPEFILES FROM THE
# L DRIVE.  MICHELLE PLATZ ENTERED DATA INTO THE SHAPEFILE.  SINCE
# WE REALLY DON'T NEED THE FULL SHAPEFILE FOR THE ANALYSIS, WE WILL
# JUST WORK WITH THE .dbf FILE.

# LIBRARY----------
# source("ohio2016/scriptsAndRmd/masterLibrary.R")

# READ IN .dbf FILES-------------------

# 1. Create a list of files to read in.  The completed data files all
# contain the pattern ...SitesEqAreaData.dbf and are stored in 
# L:/Priv/Cin/NRMRL/ReservoirEbullitionStudy/multiResSurvey2016/grtsDesign/
# directory.

                        recursive = TRUE) # look in all subdirectories


# 2.  Read in files
mylist <- list()  # Create an empty list to hold data

for (i in 1:length(fileNames)){  # for each file
  # read.dbf is in foreign and spsurvey.  The foreign version allows for
  # use of as.is argument.
  data.i <- foreign::read.dbf(paste(rootDir, fileNames[i], sep = ""),

# files.  Inconsistency related to source of original GIS shapefile.

# remove columns from all dfs in list
mylist1 <- lapply(mylist, function(x) select(x, -matches(columnsToRemove))) # matches allows for multiple terms

# Some dfs in list have column name "GNIS_Name".  Rename to Lake_Name where it appears. 
# ;x needed to have function report whole df.
mylist2 <- lapply(mylist1, function(x) {names(x) <- sub("GNIS_Name", "Lake_Name", names(x));x})

# Add 'section' as column, if not already present.  This happens in equal area designs
mylist3 <- lapply(mylist2, function(x){
  if("section" %in% names(x))  # if 'section' already exists
    x  # then report original df
  else

})
                                          
# 4.  Arrange columns in identical way to facilitate rbind
mylist4 <- lapply(mylist3, function(x) {
  select(x, noquote(order(colnames(x))))} # sort colnames alphabetically
  )
